A Simple web Appliction in Symfony
===================================
The intended use of this application is for a manager to assign tasks to each of his employee. Each employee can update the status (open, working or closed) on the tasks assigned to him/her, which can be later verified by the manager. The application has two sections: employee section and managerial section.
Run the application using:
   http://localhost:8080/

For verification sample input:
  Employee:
    u name:sumith
    p word:sumith
  Manager:
    username:admin
    password:admin
  
Limitations:
  
1.Maximum number of task assigned to each employee is limited to three.
2.The authentication mechanism is static in the managerial section.
